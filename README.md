# Chapter 1 : Day 1 
  1: Couple scans later... the Blockchain means to me 
     a place for people to write and deploy smart contracts
     with shared databases on different nodes on a network.
     People can then use transactions to run these smart contracts.
  
  2: A smart contract is a simple program stored on the blockchain
     that participants involed can rely on smart contracts automateing
     the process and know that they both be satified with the outcome.
     
  3: A transaction is a glorified paid function call, and a script is
     used to view data on the blockchain and has no cost.
