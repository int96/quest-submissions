# Chapter 1.0 : Day 1 
  1: The Blockchain in my own words  
     A place for people to write and deploy smart contracts
     with shared databases on different nodes on a network.
     People can then use transactions to run these smart contracts.
  
  2: A smart contract is a simple program stored on the blockchain
     that participants involed can rely on smart contracts automateing
     the process and know that they both will be satified with the outcome.
     
  3: A transaction is a glorified paid function call, and a script is
     used to view data on the blockchain and has no cost.<br>
     <i>JT:</i><br>
     <i>...transactions are paid, scripts are free. Transactions change data on the blockchain, scripts simply read data</i>
     
# Chapter 1.0 : Day 2
  
  1: Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programming
  
  2: The five pillars are useful because they keep everything inline and incheck without it there would only 
     be chaos. With all five pillars in place everyone involved can feel at ease when approaching a secure and 
     easy to mangage application.

# Chapter 2.0 : Day 2
  1: Because it doesn't modify the state. We want to change our information.<br>
  2: If we need to access data on an account we can use AuthAccount in the prepare phase which means we are approving this transation.<br>
  3: Difference in Prepare Phase and Execute Phase is Prepare is where we access the information/data in the account and Execute is when we change the data.<br>
